Quantum Machine Learning Classification Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for binary classification using Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation and scikit-learn for classical machine learning components. A synthetic dataset is generated, transformed using a quantum kernel, and used to train a QSVM. The decision boundary is visualized to showcase how quantum-enhanced kernels can impact classification tasks.

This project highlights the emerging potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and its application in real-world scenarios as quantum hardware continues to evolve.

🌐 Future Potential of QML
Quantum Machine Learning holds promise across multiple industries:

Drug Discovery: Accelerated molecular modeling and simulation.

Finance: Improved portfolio optimization and risk analysis using quantum-enhanced insights.

Cybersecurity: Development of quantum-safe machine learning algorithms.

Scalability: Ability to model complex, high-dimensional data with quantum feature maps.
