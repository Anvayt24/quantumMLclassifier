## Quantum ML Classifier 🚀



Welcome to Quantum ML Classifier, a cutting-edge Quantum Machine Learning (QML) project that harnesses the power of quantum computing to perform binary classification using a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM). Built with Qiskit and scikit-learn, this project showcases how quantum algorithms can transform data science and offers a glimpse into the future of AI! 🌌

# Why Quantum ML? 🌟

Quantum Machine Learning is set to redefine what's possible in AI:

-Blazing Speed: Quantum algorithms like HHL can solve complex computations exponentially faster.
-Rich Feature Spaces: Quantum feature maps unlock high-dimensional data representations for superior pattern detection.
-Future-Ready: From drug discovery to finance, QML could power breakthroughs in molecular simulations, portfolio optimization, and quantum-safe cryptography.
-Scalability: As quantum hardware evolves, projects like this will lead the way in tackling massive datasets and complex problems.

This project is your entry point to exploring QML's potential with a hands-on, scalable demo!

# Getting Started 🛠️

Prerequisites
-Python 3.8 or higher
